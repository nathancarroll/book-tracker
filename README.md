# Book Tracker

I made this app to help keep track of books I've read and books I'd still like to read. It is built in the SEAN stack of web technologies: SQL, Expresss, AngularJS, and node.js. Users can search books by title on the Search Books view, which queries the Google Books API for results. The styling and popups are done using AngularJS Material.
